# Status
Quick write-up here for the archive as to why this is discontinued.

Andlarweb was intended to be a long term project I could continuously add to and iterate on. While I was going at it at first, it went great. As anticipated, I took a break for the sake of another semester of studying. Coming back to the project later proved to be a gargantuan task. While I'm still happy with a lot of the code I've made, and where the project was headed, I believe the groundwork here is a mess. I've grown to dislike the React + Django combination, and would much rather look forward to a more basic approach. While Material-UI was also a fun toy to play with, I did not particularly enjoy it, nor find that it challenged me creatively design-wise.

For the forseeable future, I'm going to look towards conrete projects with smaller scopes that I can actually complete and potentially combine later down the line. I want to finish a project, and a larger undertaking like andlarweb requires rock solid groundwork. I'm still very much in the earlier stages of programming, and I need more freedom to scorch the earth and begin anew with new knowledge. Smaller projects are more suited to that end.

Really only writing this so I have a reminder why I'm not going to dig into this project again every time I'm tempted. I for sure will return to the concept later when I have a clearer idea of what I want to do, and how I want to do it.

Website built on Django, React, Webpack and Material UI

It's a serious work in progress, and it's mostly a learning experience, but this is what will culminate into my first website that doesn't consist of 99% Lorem Ipsum.

I've just barely begun, so it'll be a good little while until I push this stuff out to a production version. Not really keeping any sensitive data around here anyways, but I imagine I'll make a whole lot of mistakes, like uploading the entire database or something.

Half the code is shamelessly copy-pasted from [OW4](https://github.com/dotKom/onlineweb4), and oh my goodness am I glad I can rely on [dotkom](https://github.com/dotKom) for guidance.
