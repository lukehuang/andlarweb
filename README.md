Website built on Django, React, Webpack and Material UI

It's a serious work in progress, and it's mostly a learning experience, but this is what will culminate into my first website that doesn't consist of 99% Lorem Ipsum.

I've just barely begun, so it'll be a good little while until I push this stuff out to a production version. Not really keeping any sensitive data around here anyways, but I imagine I'll make a whole lot of mistakes, like uploading the entire database or something.

Half the code is shamelessly copy-pasted from [OW4](https://github.com/dotKom/onlineweb4), and oh my goodness am I glad I can rely on [dotkom](https://github.com/dotKom) for guidance.
